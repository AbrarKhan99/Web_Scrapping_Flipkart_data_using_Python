## 🌟 Introduction

Web scraping is a powerful technique to extract structured data from websites, and this project demonstrates how it can be applied to gather information about OnePlus mobile phones available on Flipkart. By utilizing Beautiful Soup and Python, I've scraped product details, prices, discounts, and more, making it accessible for further analysis.

## ✨ Features

- 🌐 **Web Scraping**: Retrieve data from Flipkart's OnePlus mobiles page.
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Utilize pandas to clean and organize the scraped data.
- 📊 **Data Representation**: Present the data in a user-friendly tabular format using dataframes.
- 💰 **Price Insights**: Calculate the total savings based on discounts.
- 📈 **Data Analysis**: The cleaned data can be further analyzed to gain insights into OnePlus mobiles' pricing trends and discounts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these simple steps:

1. Click on the python code and download the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Open it in your local machine using Jupyter Notebook.

## 🔧 Dependencies

Make sure to install the following Python libraries to run the project:

- Beautiful Soup 4
- Requests
- Pandas

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas
```

## 💡 How It Works

The web scraping process involves:

1. Sending an HTTP request to Flipkart's OnePlus mobiles page.
2. Parsing the HTML content with Beautiful Soup to extract relevant information.
3. Cleaning the data using Pandas.
4. Creating a dataframe to represent the data in a structured tabular format.
5. Saving the cleaned data to a CSV file for further analysis.

## 📊 Data Structure

The dataframe consists of the following columns:

- `Product Name`: Name of the OnePlus mobile.
- `Price Without Discount`: Original price of the mobile.
- `Discount Percentage`: Percentage of discount offered.
- `Price After Discount`: Price of the mobile after applying the discount.
- `Total Savings`: Calculated savings based on the discount.

## 💼 Usage

Feel free to use the extracted data for various purposes, including:

- Analyzing OnePlus mobile pricing trends.
- Comparing discounts and savings.
- Creating data visualizations.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

This project can be extended with the following enhancements:

- Scheduling automated data updates.
- Adding more data points such as customer ratings and reviews.
- Implementing data visualization with Matplotlib or Plotly.

Happy web scraping and data analysis! 🌐📈🔍
